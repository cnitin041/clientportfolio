  "description": "A set of Houdini utilities that enable quick local iterations on complex simulations. Focused on caching, dependency tracking, and reproducible results.",
  "technologies": ["Houdini", "Python", "PDG", "OpenCL"],
  "content": [
    "This development sprint introduced a lightweight job runner to orchestrate local simulation steps with reliable caching and resuming.",
    "It integrates with PDG where possible, and falls back to a Python-based queue for single-machine workflows.",
    "Key outcome: reduced iteration time by ~40% on typical FX shots."
